Emission
PLN ask the Bidder to comply with the new regulation without changing his Price and his
Performance Guarantee which has been stipulated in his Price Proposal at Stage II (Including
Performance Guarantee in Schedule 6).
This matter has been discussed during clarification meeting on July, 26 2019.
Discussion:
Bidder:
As per Minutes of Meeting on July, 26 2019, considering to new regulation, to achieve NOx
emission level, SNCR installation (including Ammonia Pump) is required and to achieve SOx
(~
emission level, increasing feeding flow of limestone is required.
Increasing use of limestone will impact of increasing fly ash, bottom ash, dust production, thus
related system (such as: ash cooler, ash conveyor, limestone feeding system , etc) and ESP
size and loading capacity is increased as well.

Both parties agree with the following based on Min.µtes of Clarification Meeting on July, 26 2019
with subject New Regulation of Ministry for The Environment:
A. For EPC
1. ~Considering the above discussion, Bidder will apply new design for Clause 4.3.16
Environmental and Safety Consideration such as install SNCR, increase limestqne
handling facility and all related equipment to meet new emission regulation without any
cost implication and without the date of announcement condition as mentioned in the
Minutes of Clarification Meeting on July, 26 2019;
2. Performance Guarantee for EPC as per Schedule 6 (Bidder's proposal), the value will
not be changed, with the following condition to meet performance guarantee based on
old emission regulation (NOx : 750 mg/Nm3, SOx : 750mg/Nm
3
, Particulate : 100
mg/Nm3):
1)
Ammonia pump can be stopped during performance test.
2)
Auxiliary power for ESP shall be treated as per the current figure 73 kW per unit (as
per Bid?er's 'pro~osal in Schedule 6, Table Unit Auxiliary Power Consumption, Point
No. 19). However, if partial operation of ESP can be applied on Performance Test,
then the partial operation is prevailed instead of the current figure 73 kW per unit (as
per Bidder's proposal in Schedule 6, Table Unit Auxiliary Power Consumption, Point
No. 19).
Anyhow, Bidder declares that the plant is designed to meet new emission regulation
(NOx : 200 mg/Nm3, SOx : 200mg/Nm3, Particulate : 50 mg/Nm\

B. ForO&M
Emission
1. Bidder can maintain his Performance Guarantee for O&M as stipulated in Schedule 6
(Bidder's proposal) to meet performance guarantee based on new emission regulation
(NOx : 200 mg/Nm
3
, SOx : 200 mg/Nm3, Particulate : 50 mg/Nm3). However, to
guarantee the Net Output, the following condition has to be fulfilled :
1)
The power consumption for ammonia pump will not be calculated for O&M period.
2)
For First Year, Auxiliary power for ESP shall be treated as per the current figure 73
kW per unit (as per Bidder's proposal in Schedule 6 for EPC, Table Unit Auxiliary
Power Consumption, Point No. 19). However for second year until fifth year use the
real measurement.
Anyhow, Bidder declares that the plant is designed to meet new emission regulation
(NOx : 200 mg/Nm3, SOx : 200mg/Nm3, Particulate : 50 mg/Nm3).
Conclusion:
Date: Auqust 26-2?1n, 2019
Price schedule will be updated to accommodate SNCR system and its other component

the same conditions, so far as applicable, as though the said variations
were stated in the Contract.
The Contractor shall carry out minor variations that do not significantly

decrease in the Contract Price, the Contractor shall within fourteen (14)
days, advise the details of work involved and changes to the Contract Price
to the Owner in writing to that effect.

by negotiations between the Owner and the Contractor.
Should the Owner make any such variations in any part of the Works, such
reasonable notice in writing will be given to the Contractor as will enable
him to make his arrangements accordingly, and in cases where Plant is
already manufactured or in course of manufacture, or any matter done or
